# How does it work?



This project takes novels in the form of .txt files with UTF-8 enconding and turns them into CSV files for anyone to practice basic ETL concepts.

Simply pass in your desired novel in the book.py file, make adjustments to the dictionary in random_dataset.py file, and run the code.
After that go crazy with your practice.
